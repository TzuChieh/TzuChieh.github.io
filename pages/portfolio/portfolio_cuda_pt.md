## Introduction

This was one of the coursework of Adj. Prof. [Wei-Chao Chen](www.weichaochen.org)'s course *GPGPU Programming Spring 2016*. A basic path tracer with emissive, refractive, reflective, and diffusive material were implemented in the CUDA based core.

## Generated Video

To demonstrate the renderer, I rendered a video with several balls (each assigned a different material) bouncing around the classic Cornell Box scene. A rigid body collision algorithm was integrated alongside the rendering core.
