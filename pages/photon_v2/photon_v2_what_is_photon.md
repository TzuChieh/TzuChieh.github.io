Photon-v2 is a rendering engine made out of my love for computer graphics. A rendering engine is what takes geometrical descriptions and material properties of a 3-D scene as input, and outputs a 2-D image of that scene from a specific point of view. In layman's terms, it is like taking a photograph, except the scene and the camera are both computer simulated. This project is still actively being developed, and more features are expected to come.

## Research

It is recommended to use the **master** branch for your research, as **master** is guaranteed to have critical bugs fixed and is not as volatile as **develop**. 

If you use Photon in your research project, you are hightly encouraged to cite it using the following BibTeX template:

```latex.bib
@misc{Photon,
	Author = {Tzu-Chieh Chang},
	Year   = {2016--2019},
	Title  = {Photon renderer},
	Note   = {https://github.com/TzuChieh/Photon-v2}
}
```

## Releases

* [Photon 2.0.0-beta]() (TBD)
