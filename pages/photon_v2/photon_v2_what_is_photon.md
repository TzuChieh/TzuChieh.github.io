Photon-v2 is a rendering engine made out of my love for computer graphics. A rendering engine is what takes geometrical descriptions and material properties of a 3-D scene as input, and outputs a 2-D image of that scene from a specific point of view. In layman's terms, it is like taking a photograph, except the scene and the camera are both computer simulated. This project is still actively being developed, and more features are expected to come.

* Visit the [documentation website](https://tzuchieh.github.io/Photon-v2-site/engine_docs/v2.0.0-beta/Photon/html/index.html) for more information.
* We also have a [feature overview page](https://tzuchieh.github.io/Photon-v2-site/engine_docs/v2.0.0-beta/Photon/html/main_feature_overview.html) that is more thorough and up-to-date than this site.
* Full [source code](https://github.com/TzuChieh/Photon-v2) available.

## Research

It is recommended to use the **master** branch for your research, as **master** is guaranteed to have critical bugs fixed and is not as volatile as **develop**. For bleeding-edge features or bugfixes **develop** can be a good choice.

If you use Photon in your research project, you are hightly encouraged to cite it using the following BibTeX template:

```latex.bib
@software{Photon,
    Title  = {Photon renderer},
    Author = {Tzu-Chieh Chang},
    Year   = {2016--2024},
    Note   = {https://github.com/TzuChieh/Photon-v2}
} 
```
