Photon-v2 is a rendering engine made out of my love for computer graphics. A rendering engine is what takes geometrical descriptions and material properties of a 3-D scene as input, and outputs a 2-D image of that scene from a specific point of view. In layman's terms, it is like taking a photograph, except the scene and the camera are both computer simulated. This project is still actively being developed, and more features are expected to come.
