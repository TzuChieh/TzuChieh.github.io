If there is a ball in the scene, we can create a sphere geometry to represent it; if there is a piece of paper on the table, we can use a rectangle geometry to model it. Geometries are the barebone of a scene: materials, lights, physical motions... are all built on top of geometries, they are basically the heart of a virtual world.
