# Introduction

Here, you will learn about the scene description language used in Photon (sometimes we call it PSDL for convenience, which stands for **P**hoton **S**cene **D**escription **L**anguage). It is a special format created for storing scene data as well as controlling the behavior of the render engine. Currently we have Python and Java APIs for users to programmatically build scene descriptions, and a documentation for engine features exposed as PSDL can be found [here](photon_v2_sdl_documentation.html).

## Language Basics

A hello-world scene rendered by Photon looks like this

{% include image_gallery.html file="photon_v2/sdl_hello_world_scene.jpg" alt="" caption="Rendered hello-world scene" width="60%" %}

This image can be generated by feeding the following descriptions into Photon:

```cpp
## camera(pinhole) [real fov-degree 30] [vector3 position "0 6 40"] [vector3 direction "0 0 -1"] [vector3 up-axis "0 1 0"]
## sample-generator(stratified) [integer sample-amount 10]
## renderer(equal-sampling) [integer width 512][integer height 512][string filter-name gaussian][string estimator bneept]

-> geometry(rectangle) @plane [real width 15] [real height 15]
-> geometry(sphere)    @ball  [real radius 2.5]

-> material(matte-opaque) @white [vector3 albedo "0.9 0.9 0.9"]

-> actor(model) @ground [geometry geometry @plane] [material material @white]
-> actor(model) rotate(@ground) [vector3 axis "1 0 0"] [real degree -90]
-> actor(model) scale(@ground) [vector3 factor "10 10 10"]

-> actor(model) @object [geometry geometry @ball]  [material material @white]
-> actor(model) translate(@object) [vector3 factor "0 2.5 0"]

-> light-source(rectangle) @areaSource [vector3 linear-srgb "1 1 0.8"] [real watts 400] [real width 2] [real height 2]
-> actor(light) @topLight [light-source light-source @areaSource]
-> actor(light) translate(@topLight) [vector3 factor "0 10 0"]
-> actor(light) rotate(@topLight) [vector3 axis "1 0 0"] [real degree 90]
```

{% include note.html content="More example scenes can be found in the \"scenes\" folder in the GitHub repository." %}

The scene description can be stored into a text file (.p2 filename extension) and loaded by Photon for rendering. PSDL is a command-like system and the commands can be roughly categorized into 2 parts: **core** and **world**.

Also, commands are normally structured in the following way (without the angle brackets):

`<command-prefix>` `<type-category>`(`<type-name>`) `<name>` `<clauses>`

where `<command-prefix>` is the part that you can distinguish between core and world categories.

> Core commands start with prefix `##`. For example, to create a pinhole camera, we write:

```c
## camera(pinhole) [real fov-degree 30] [vector3 position "0 0 0"] [vector3 direction "0 0 -1"]
```

> World commands start with prefix `->`. To create a unit-sized rectangle, we may write:

```csharp
-> geometry(rectangle) @plane [real width 1] [real height 1]
```

Note that in most cases, core commands no not have the `<name>` part.

> To disable a command or write some comment, simply put two slashes before the line:

```java
// These commands are being disabled
//## camera(pinhole) [real fov-degree 30] [vector3 position "0 0 0"] [vector3 direction "0 0 -1"]
//-> geometry(rectangle) @plane [real width 1] [real height 1]
```

{% include important.html content="You must start a command with either \"##\" or \"->\", and at least a white space after them." %}

In the next sections, we will focus on the remaining structures of PSDL commands.
