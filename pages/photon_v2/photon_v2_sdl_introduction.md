# Introduction

Here, you will learn about the scene description language used in Photon (sometimes we call it PSDL for convenience, which stands for **P**hoton **S**cene **D**escription **L**anguage). It is a special format created for storing scene data as well as controlling the behavior of the render engine. Currently we have Python and Java APIs for users to programmatically build scene descriptions, and a documentation for engine features exposed as PSDL can be found [here](photon_v2_sdl_documentation.html).

## Language Basics

A hello-world scene described using our scene description format whould look like this

{% include image_gallery.html file="photon_v2/sdl_hello_world_scene.jpg" alt="" caption="Rendered hello-world scene" width="50%" %}

This image can be generated by feeding the following descriptions into Photon:

```lisp
## camera(pinhole) [real fov-degree 30] [vector3 position "0 6 40"] [vector3 direction "0 0 -1"] [vector3 up-axis "0 1 0"]
## sample-generator(stratified) [integer sample-amount 10]
## renderer(equal-sampling) [integer width 512][integer height 512][string filter-name gaussian][string estimator bneept]

-> geometry(rectangle) @plane [real width 15] [real height 15]
-> geometry(sphere)    @ball  [real radius 2.5]

-> material(matte-opaque) @white [vector3 albedo "0.9 0.9 0.9"]

-> actor(model) @ground [geometry geometry @plane] [material material @white]
-> actor(model) rotate(@ground) [vector3 axis "1 0 0"] [real degree -90]
-> actor(model) scale(@ground) [vector3 factor "10 10 10"]

-> actor(model) @object [geometry geometry @ball]  [material material @white]
-> actor(model) translate(@object) [vector3 factor "0 2.5 0"]

-> light-source(rectangle) @areaSource [vector3 linear-srgb "1 1 0.8"] [real watts 400] [real width 2] [real height 2]
-> actor(light) @topLight [light-source light-source @areaSource]
-> actor(light) translate(@topLight) [vector3 factor "0 10 0"]
-> actor(light) rotate(@topLight) [vector3 axis "1 0 0"] [real degree 90]
```
