Hi, there! I am a computer graphics enthusiast who loves developing physics simulators, including real-time and offline renderers. You can find descriptions about my projects on this site. If you feel like we can be good friends or just want to have a chat, feel free to get in touch with me.

I am currently studying for a Master's degree at the Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering in National Taiwan University. My main areas of research interest are in light transport simulations and the design and implementation of graphics software.

Previously, I did my undergraduate studies at the Department of Mechanical Engineering in National Taiwan University.
